**LoopList – Social Streak Tracker for Micro-Habits**

**Scenario:**
Everyone wants to build better habits — but most habit trackers are either private and dull, or overly complex. Whats missing is a streak-first, publicly accountable, visually rewarding system to make micro-habit building fun.

LoopList lets users commit to tiny recurring habits, track streaks visually, and share public commitment boards where others can cheer, clone, or compete.

**Objective:**
Build a fullstack app where users can:
* Create recurring micro-habits (aka loops)
* Track their daily progress and streaks
* Make habit boards public or private
* Explore trending habits and clone them
* React or cheer others public loops

**User Role:** `user`
Only one role — users can track their own habits, browse public ones, and interact with others through reactions and cloning.

**Authentication & Authorization:**
* Secure login/signup via email
* All habit loops and progress data are private by default
* Public boards can be explored without login, but reactions/clones require auth

**Core Functional Features:**

**1. Create a Loop**
Form includes:
* **Loop Title** (e.g., "Read 10 pages", "No sugar after 7pm")
* **Frequency**: Daily / 3x per week / Weekdays / Custom
* **Start Date**
* **Public toggle**: `Private`, `Public`, `Friends only`
* Optional emoji icon or cover image

**2. Track Your Streaks**
Daily check-in: tap to mark as done Loop state:
* :large_green_square: **Active** = if streak is ongoing
* :large_red_square: **Broken** = if a day is missed
* :white_check_mark: **Completed** = if a loop had a time limit

Show:
* Current streak
* Longest streak
* Completion rate
* Loop heatmap calendar (inspired by GitHub)

**3. Public Loop Boards**
* Users can view others public loops:
   * "Cheer" with an emoji reaction
   * "Clone this loop" to try it themselves
   * See how many others are doing it
